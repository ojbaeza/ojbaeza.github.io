Hi! My name is Ã“scar J. Baeza, but I'm also known as OJ.

I'm a senior PHP developer at marketgoo, podcaster at Kafelog and my own personal podcast, early bird fitboxer, casual gamer on Xbox and Switch, synesthetic & true neutral.

Besides, I'm really into tech, food, drink, (hard) sci-fi & (space) horror, sneakers & low-profile mechanical keyboards.
